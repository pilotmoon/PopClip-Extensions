# Under Construction

![classic under construction gif](https://raw.github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/master/docs-assets/construction.gif)

This is work-in-progress documentation for PopClip's JavaScript programming interface. It's a bit rough and ready, please bear with my while I complete the docs.

Beware that some of it might be inaccurate because I have evolved the API over time and documented as I went.

This documentation is auto-generated from the popclip.d.ts file in the repo. This is a TypeScript definitions file which can be used with a TypeScript
compatible editor such as VS.Code for correctness checking and autocompletion.

A good starting point is probably the [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.github.io/PopClip-Extensions/interfaces/PopClip.html) object.
