### Notes

Author: Nick Moore.

The original extension used [html2text](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html2text/3.200.3) by Aaron Swartz.

The updated JavaScript extension uses [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown).

Hat-tip to Brett Terpstra whose [Web Markdownifier](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/12/23/web-markdownifier-for-popclip/) extension inspired this one.
