# Readwise

Save a highlight to [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) or a URL to [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read).

The extension has two actions:

- **Save Highlight**: Saves any text as a highlight in [Readwise](https://readwise.io/). When clipped from a supported browser, the source page URL and title will be included.
- **Save Article**: Appears only when you select a URL. The URL will be saved as an article in [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read).

You can choose whether each action appears by toggling it on or off in the extension's settings.

## Configuration

- **Access Token**: Obtain your token from <https://readwise.io/access_token>.
