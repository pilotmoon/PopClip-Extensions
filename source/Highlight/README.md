# Highlight PopClip Extension

This extension is a replacement for the PreviewHighlight extension. The intention is to add support for all apps which have a "Highlight" keyboard shortcut. 

(Please note: Microsoft Word's highlight feature is not accessible via a keyboard shortcut, so cannot be added.)

### ⌃⌘H
- Preview
- PDF Expert
- Skim
- Evernote
- Obsidian

### ⇧⌘H
- Pages
- Scrivener
- Logseq

### ⇧⌘L
