# Comma List

Split a comma-separated list into separate lines, and vice versa.

The extension has two actions, both with the same icon, which appear only when the text selection contains a suitable input:

* The **Join with commas** action is available when the text selection contains more than one line (ignoring blank lines). It replaces each newline with a comma and a space. Blank lines, and spaces at the start and end of lines, are ignored.
* The **Split into lines** action is available when the text selection is a single line, with at least one comma. It replaces the commas (and any spaces around the commas), with newlines.
