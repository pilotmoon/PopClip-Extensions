# Evernote

Send the selected text to [Evernote](https://evernote.com/).

The extension has a single action that takes text as input and sends it to Evernote as a new note in your default notebook. Captures current web page title and URL, if available.

This extension communicates directly with Evernote's servers and requires signing in to your Evernote account.
