# PopClip BBEdit-Tabd Extension README

This extension for [PopClip][pclip] will take the selected text and create a new `text document` in [BBEdit][tw], using Tabs instead of a new window (because I prefer it that way).

After using [TextWranger][tw] for a while, and even creating a [Popclip extension][twext] for it, I've since moved to using [BBEdit][bb]... but the existing Popclip extension in the [extension repo][extsource] ([BBEdit Extension][bbeditext]) didn't work as I wanted.

So I've copied the existing BBEdit extension and changed it accordingly to create a tab.

The usual caveats: works for me, don't blame me if this blows up your computer, etc, etc...
