# Highlight PopClip Extension

This extension is a replacement for the PreviewHighlight extension. The
intention is to add support for all apps which have a "Highlight" keyboard
shortcut.

(Please note: Microsoft Word's highlight feature is not accessible via a
keyboard shortcut, so cannot be added.)
