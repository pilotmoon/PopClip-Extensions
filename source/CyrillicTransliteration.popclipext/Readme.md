# Cyrillic Transliteration

Transliterates Cyrillic text to Latin characters using the official (scientific) transliteration.

This extension is based on the table (in the file "\_Transliteration table.numbers" in the source repository) provided by user Koen on the PopClip forum in [this thread](https://forum.popclip.app/t/cyrillic-transliteration/824).

> Slavists (and other linguists) usually refer to this as the scientific transliteration that is common in scientific publications. The normative reference is certainly the journal Russian Linguistics, a peer-reviewed journal devoted to the empirical and theoretical study of Russian and other Slavic languages in all their diversity. This transliteration is used in this journal published by Springer.
