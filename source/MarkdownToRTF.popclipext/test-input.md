# About Markdown

 [Markdown]  is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML. It supports **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ and `code` styles.

## Example Level Two Heading

1. This is an ordered list.
2. Old Macdonald had a farm.

That was an ordered list.

- **Unordered List:** Markdown supports unordered lists too
  - subitem
  - subitem 2
      1. apple
      2. banana
      3. _Strawberry_
  - further sub-item
    - 3rd level list
      - 4th level **list**
        -  How deep does this go????
      - woohah
  - and another subitem
- **Stuff:**  Another line in this list.
- **More Stuff:**  How do you do. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. How do you do. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. How do you do.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. How do you do.

- Starting a new list with a blank line before
* changing to a asterisk to start the list
* Carrying on the asterisk list
1. Starting a numbered list
2. number two

### Why Markdown?

Also, as the creator of Markdown says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

Here is a code block:

````
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  return 0;
}
````

And a final line.
