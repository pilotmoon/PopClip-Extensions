# Glosbe

A PopClip extension for searching the multi-language dictionary website, [Glosbe](https://glosbe.com/).

A source and destination language need to be set in the options. This is done using an ISO code string, can be looked up [here](https://glosbe.com/all-languages). (Since there are more than 6000 supported languages, it is impractical to have a drop-down menu.)

### Requirements

Requires PopClip 2021.10 (3543) or above.
