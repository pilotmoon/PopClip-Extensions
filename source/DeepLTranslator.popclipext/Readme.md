# DeepL Translator

Translate the text with [DeepL Translator desktop app](https://www.deepl.com/macos-app).

The extension has a single action that takes text as input and sends it either to the DeepL app.

The DeepL app must be already running and the DeeplL's app shortcut must be set to "âŒ˜+C+C" (the default).
