# TaskPaper

Send the text to [TaskPaper 3](https://www.taskpaper.com) ("Plain text to-do lists for Mac").

The extension has one action, which takes the selected plain text and adds it as a new task in the Inbox project of the open TaskPaper document.

If no TaskPaper document is currently open, the extension will show an "X".

## About

This is an extension for [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/).
