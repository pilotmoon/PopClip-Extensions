# Base64

Encode and decode text using Base64 encoding.

The extension defines two actions:

* **Base64 Encode:** Enabled for all text inputs. It is actually a two-stage process: the text is first encoded to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and then the bytes are encoded in Base64.

* **Base64 Decode:** Enabled for inputs which only contain Base64-legal characters. Decoding is the reverse of encoding. If the decoded bytes are not valid UTF-8, the action will fail and show an 'X'.

The extenson has the following options:

* *Base64 Variant*: Choose from *Standard* or *URL Safe*. In the URL Safe variant, the `+` and `/` characters are mapped to `-` and `_` when encoding. (Default: Standard)
  
* *Trim `=` padding*: Whether to trim off any trailing `=` or `==` padding after encoding. (Default: yes)

The decode action will accept both Standard and URL Safe variants, with or without `=` padding.
