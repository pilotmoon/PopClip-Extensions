# Mastodon Follow

## Description

This [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) extension defines a single
action. The action appears only if the input text looks like an ActivityPub
account, such as `@feditips@mstdn.social` (with or without the preceding `@`).
The action will attempt to follow the account on the configured Mastodon
instance.

## Configuration

Initially the extension config asks you to provide the URL of your Mastodon
instance. You should paste the full server URL of your instance, for example:
`https://mastodonapp.uk`.

Then click `Sign In`, authorize the extension in Mastodon, and you should be
good to go.
