# Obsidian Next PopClip Extension

This is a simplified version of the [Obsidian PopClip Extension][obsidian-ext] with the following changes:

- a separate standalone extension to capture text to Obsidian
- a different name (ObsidianNext)
- a different icon (iconify:simple-icons:snapcraft)
- a different identifier (popclip.extension.obsidiannext)
- set **Always create new file** to true by default
- removed the option to capture Heading

Please refer to the original extension for configuration options and
