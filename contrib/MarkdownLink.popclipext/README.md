##Markdown Link extension for PopClip

The common form of Makrdown link is ... `[a Title](a URL)`.
Simple enough, but needs key-in `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, then copy/paste a Title and a URL.

PopClip mdLink extension can simplify as 2 selections/clicks or just 1 selectection/click(in Safari/Chrome). 

- case 1: selected text is URL

	Markdown Link = `[` clipboard text `](` selected text `)`

- case 2: in Safari or Chrome

	Markdown Link = `[` selected text `](` browser URL `)`
