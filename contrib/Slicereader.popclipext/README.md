# Slicereader

A simple [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/) extension that allows any chunk of selected text to be read in [Slicereader](http://mthr.me/slicereader/), a great little app for breaking up large amounts of text and presenting it in a readable way. Check out the website for more information.

Obviosuly this requires [Slicereader](http://mthr.me/slicereader/) to be installed, and as the extension makes uses of the app’s Service, “Read in Slicereader”, this needs to be activated in settings.
